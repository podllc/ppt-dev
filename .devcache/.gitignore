# DevCache Git Ignore
# ============================================================================
# This directory contains cached data for development containers including:
# - VS Code Server and extensions
# - .NET tool cache
# - NuGet package cache
# - Bash history
# - NPM global packages
#
# These caches can grow large (3-4GB per service) but provide significant
# speedup by persisting across container rebuilds.
# ============================================================================

# Ignore everything by default
*

# But track this gitignore file
!.gitignore

# Track shared directories for cross-container tool sharing
